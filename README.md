# elementsofwords
Basically my attempt to solve the classic "word-break problem".

# Description
Simple web page using a predefined array of different akronyms of the elements in the periodic table. Combined with an array of images of the period elements.
When using the input field of the page, the algorithms find if you can spell the input with the help of akronymed elements.
The output is a visualization of how you would spell that word using the elements of the periodic table.
Think of the logo for "Breaking bad" in this context.
